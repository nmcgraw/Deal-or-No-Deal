Deal-or-No-Deal
===============

This is the repository for my Deal or No Deal game. Included are three files (excluding this readme):

- Deal.java (the main class, through which the program interacts with the user)
- Case.java (the class that contains the information for a case in the game)
- Scoreboard.java (the class that builds a graphical user interface showing the remaining cases and case values)

This program is exclusive to Java. The console plays the role of Howie Mandel, and the "banker," normally a human entity, is replaced by a mathematical calculator that considers the remaining cases and values when making an offer.
